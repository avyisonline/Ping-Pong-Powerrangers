/// This script is basically the back bone of this whole thing! It makes score work, it makes the ball go bouncy, it does all sorts of cool shit
/// It even has a little TMPro thingy in it, so it edits the scoreboard in real time. No need for looking at the console to check if you're #winning or not.
/// Go me, I am so great for making this.
